# Claude Code and Codex skills

Claudex automatically makes existing Claude Code and Codex skills available in
ordinary GPT backed sessions. Source skills are never moved, rewritten, or
deleted. Claudex creates a private compatibility view under
`~/.config/claudex/skill-bridge` for each project and passes that view to
Claude Code with its native skill discovery interface.

## Discovered locations

| Ecosystem | Locations available inside Claudex |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code personal | `~/.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, including skills directory plugins |
| Claude Code legacy personal commands | `~/.claude/commands/*.md` |
| Claude Code project | `.claude/skills` and `.claude/commands`, discovered natively by Claude Code |
| Claude Code plugins | Enabled user, managed, and matching project plugin installations |
| Codex personal | `~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Codex legacy/custom home | `$CODEX_HOME/skills/*/SKILL.md` |
| Codex bundled/system | `$CODEX_HOME/skills/.system/*/SKILL.md` |
| Codex project | `.agents/skills` and legacy `.codex/skills` from the launch directory through the Git repository root |
| Codex admin | `/etc/codex/skills` on Unix or `%ProgramData%\Codex\skills` on Windows |
| Codex plugins | Skills from installed and enabled Codex plugins, including Claude format plugins installed through Codex |

Set `CLAUDEX_CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when the normal Claude profile is not
`~/.claude`. Set `CLAUDEX_SKILL_EXTRA_DIRS` to an OS path list of additional
Agent Skills directories.

## Codex instructions

Claudex also snapshots the Codex instruction chain into the compatibility
overlay's `CLAUDE.md`. It selects `AGENTS.override.md` when non empty, otherwise
`AGENTS.md`, first from `CODEX_HOME` and then once per directory from the Git
repository root down to the launch directory. The resulting order matches
Codex: global guidance comes first and instructions closest to the launch
directory come last, so later guidance can override earlier guidance.

The combined snapshot uses Codex's effective `project_doc_max_bytes` setting
(32 KiB by default) and remains valid UTF-8 when a source must be truncated.
Claudex accumulates guidance in Codex order, from global through repository root
to the launch directory, and stops adding instruction files when the configured
combined limit is reached. Effective `project_doc_fallback_filenames` are used
after `AGENTS.override.md` and `AGENTS.md`; project `.codex/config.toml` values
are considered only when Codex marks the project trusted. Selected instruction
paths and full source digests
participate in the content addressed generation, so edits create a new
immutable view without rewriting the source. Project instruction symlinks must
stay inside the repository, global instruction symlinks must stay inside
`CODEX_HOME`, and unsafe or unreadable inputs are skipped with a diagnostic in
`claudex skills`. Set `CLAUDEX_INSTRUCTION_BRIDGE=off` to disable only this
instruction snapshot.

## Invocation and compatibility

Claudex publishes each valid standalone bridged skill for Claude Code's native
`/skill-name` invocation path. It preserves compatible frontmatter and support
files for Claude Code to interpret, including argument substitution,
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, dynamic context, allowed tools, skill hooks, model pins,
and `context: fork` when those features are present. Claudex does not emulate
those runtime features itself, so behavior still depends on the installed
Claude Code version and on the skill being valid for that runtime. This applies
equally to skills installed in Claude Code and skills imported from Codex.
Plugin skills retain their `/plugin-name:skill-name` namespace. Codex style
`$skill-name` and `$plugin-name:skill-name` references are resolved by an
isolated, size bounded `UserPromptSubmit` compatibility hook for both Claude
and Codex sources, including skills whose Codex policy disables implicit
invocation. The hook stays within Claude Code's 10,000-character direct context
limit and points to the complete immutable skill directory whenever an
individual skill must be truncated. Use `/skill-name arguments` when a Claude
skill depends on Claude specific argument substitution or invocation metadata;
use `$skill-name` as the Codex style instruction reference. Set
`CLAUDEX_SKILL_DOLLAR_REFERENCES=off` to disable only that hook. Run
`claudex skills` outside a session to list the exact aliases, sources,
compatibility plugins, and model mappings for the current project.

When an imported plugin contains exactly one skill and its plugin and skill
names match, Claudex also publishes the natural unqualified form. For example,
`/frontend-design` is a shortcut for
`/frontend-design:frontend-design`. If a native or standalone skill already
owns that unqualified name, Claudex omits the shortcut and keeps only the safe
namespaced form. A renamed collision such as
`/imported-frontend-design:frontend-design` receives the matching
`/imported-frontend-design` shortcut, so the namespace form shown to the model
is also a valid invocation.

Both products implement the open Agent Skills `SKILL.md` format, so skill
instructions, scripts, references, assets, and relative paths stay intact.
Claudex applies only the compatibility adaptations that are necessary:

- Codex `agents/openai.yaml` with `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false`
  becomes Claude Code `disable-model-invocation: true` while explicit
  invocation remains available.
- Claude skill model pins using Opus, Fable, Best, Sonnet, or Haiku family IDs,
  including `[1m]` selectors, map to Sol, Sol, Sol, Terra, or Luna for bridged
  personal, legacy command, and plugin sources. Native project skills remain
  source exact; Claudex's Claude family runtime aliases still route their
  requests through the Codex/OpenAI gateway.
- Legacy Claude command Markdown is exposed as a skill without changing the
  original file.
- On Windows, the bundled `/usage-limit` skill uses native PowerShell syntax;
  Unix installations use Bash.

Claude only frontmatter stays native when Claude Code understands it. Codex's
optional `agents/openai.yaml` interface metadata and dependency declarations
remain alongside the skill. A dependency still needs its corresponding tool,
MCP server, app, binary, or account authorization to be installed and enabled;
the skill bridge does not fabricate external services.

## Collisions and updates

For Claude skills, the source directory is the default identity. For Codex
skills, the required frontmatter `name` is the identity. When imported sources
collide, the highest priority imported source keeps the short alias and every
source also receives a deterministic qualified alias such as `/claude-name`,
`/codex-name`, or `/codex-legacy-name`. Claude Code classifies compatibility
views supplied through `--add-dir` as additional directory skills rather than
personal profile skills. A native project or Claudex managed isolated profile
skill therefore keeps its short alias; an imported personal conflict receives
only a qualified alias instead of claiming personal scope precedence it does
not have at runtime. Plugin namespaces remain separate. `claudex skills` shows
the resolved mapping rather than silently dropping either skill.

Native plugin namespace reservations follow the same scope rules as plugin
loading. User and managed plugins apply everywhere. Project and local plugins
reserve a namespace only in their matching project, and disabled plugins do
not reserve it. This prevents a plugin used in one repository from forcing an
unrelated imported plugin to use an `imported-` prefix elsewhere.

The bridge recomputes discovery on every launch and creates a hard bounded,
content addressed snapshot. The newest eight generations per project are kept,
with a global emergency cap, and abandoned staging directories are age- and
count bounded. Scripts, references, assets, executable bits, and
metadata all participate in the fingerprint, so an active session cannot
change underneath the user. Source trees are never linked into the runtime
view. Escaping symlinks, special files, private keys, credential files, and
unreasonably large trees are rejected without blocking other skills. Codex
user and project `[[skills.config]]` entries with `enabled = false`, Claude
`skillOverrides` states (`on`, `name-only`, `user-invocable-only`, and `off`),
`defaultEnabled`, disabled plugins, and project plugin scope are respected.
Published generations are structurally validated before cache or reuse of the
last known good version, and policy changes receive distinct generations so fallback never
crosses a compatibility policy boundary.
Existing plugin packages are never loaded wholesale: Claudex copies only their
validated skill content into generated plugins and strips plugin manifests,
hooks, MCP configuration, agents, settings, and nested component roots from a
plugin root skill. Legacy Claude plugin commands, including direct Markdown
component paths, are adapted into inert namespaced skills; their source plugin
runtime is never activated.

`claudex skills` reports MCP, app, hook, agent, language server, and settings
components that exist beside an imported skill as source runtime that was not
activated. This makes an integration requirement visible without starting a
server, trusting a hook, authorizing an account, or exposing another harness's
credentials. Use `claudex codex` or `claudex claude` when the workflow needs
the source plugin's native runtime, or pass an explicit Claude
`--mcp-config` when that is the intended configuration.

Use these opt outs only when isolation is more important than sharing:

```text
CLAUDEX_SKILL_BRIDGE=off
CLAUDEX_SKILL_PLUGINS=off
CLAUDEX_SKILL_DOLLAR_REFERENCES=off
CLAUDEX_INSTRUCTION_BRIDGE=off
```

Direct `--claude-chrome`, `--bare`, `--safe-mode`, and maintenance commands do
not receive the compatibility overlay. Direct Chrome already uses the normal
Claude profile; bare and safe modes intentionally suppress Claudex additions.
